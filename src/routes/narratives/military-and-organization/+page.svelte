	It is essentially universally accepted that the Sea Peoples were made up of a series of different
	tribes, each with their own distinct pieces of culture. However, the extent to which they were
	organized and militarized is still a topic of debate. In older academic narratives, the Sea
	Peoples were often portrayed as a military coalition that went about raiding and pillaging, and
	brought about the collapse of the Bronze Age. Today, historians have move away from this
	narrative, lending towards other more plausible explanations for their migration, as well as more
	nuance in their understanding. Today, some public sources still lead into this idea in the case of
	sensationalism.

	Some scholars argue that the groups must have formed a somewhat unified military confederation;
	the textual sources from Medinet Habu (the location of Ramesses III’s mortuary temple) do refer to
	the Sea People’s ‘leaders’ or ‘great ones’ in a general sense, and scholars commonly attribute the
	two battles depicted at Medinet Habu as indicative of the Sea People’s unified leadership
