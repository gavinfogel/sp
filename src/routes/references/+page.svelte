			Enigmatic marauders whose sudden raids and assaults played a decisive role in the collapse of
			Bronze Age civilizations across the Mediterranean.
		</li>
		<li>
			Desperate migrants driven by severe climatic changes who swarmed over the shores of the
			eastern Mediterranean, disrupting ancient societies in their quest for new lands to settle.

		<li>
			A formidable coalition of maritime tribes, whose combined strength and tactical prowess
			brought about the downfall of several prominent Bronze Age empires.

			Emerging as the proto-pirates of the Bronze Age, the Sea Peoples exploited the weakness of
			existing states, preying on commerce and coastal cities through swift naval raids.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the face of economic collapse and social upheaval in their homelands, the Sea Peoples
			embarked on a mass migration that led to conflicts with ancient Mediterranean civilizations.
		</li>
		<li>
			The Sea Peoples were not merely invaders but catalysts for cultural and social transformation,
			challenging the stagnating powers and contributing to the cultural diffusion that defined the
			early Iron Age.
		</li>
		<li>
			Some theories suggest the Sea Peoples were groups of mercenaries turned rogue, using their
			military skills to forge new territories and identities in a region rife with instability.
		</li>
		<li>
			The Sea Peoples might be the forgotten founders of new dynasties and cultures in the
			Mediterranean, as they settled and merged with indigenous populations, laying the foundations
			for future civilizations.
		</li>
		<li>
			Often painted as the primary culprits for the Bronze Age collapse, the Sea Peoples may have
			been historically scapegoated, their role perhaps exaggerated in the face of wider systemic
			failures across ancient civilizations.
